Satoshi Aviation Booking Services was started by four members at Rutgers University taking CS336 (Principles of Information and Data Management). 
The four members include: Chris Zachariah, Brain Cheng, Jason Chou and Jonathan Tsai. This website is simply a mock version of other popular Online
Travel Reservation sites like Expedia, Skyscanner and Kayak. 

Customers, Customer-Representatives and Site Administrators can log in and have access to many functions like buying flight tickets and editing 
user info and such. All the data is stored in a database hosted by AWS RDS and accessed through MySQL Workbench. This website is hosted by AWS 
EC2 and uses Tomcat 7.0 to manage the various connected JSP pages.
